				<h2>Competitive Analysis - Trello</h2>
				<p>
					Strength: There are multiple grouping methods to help organize to-do lists in Trello: board, column and card. The varieties provide users with plenty of ways to bring order to their messy daily lives. There is a strong correlation between the real world and Trello’s design. Visuals of card reflect the properties of card in real world through adding a drop shadow around the element. Its above the surface visual look also provides enough information to tell the users that they can drag the element freely. 

					Weaknesses With a to-do app with so many layers of organizational structure, I want to be able to find a place in which I can see all of my to-dos at once. However, such function doesn’t seem to be supported by the computer. It takes 3 steps to go to any to-do item, which is quite long for a task management app.

				<h2>Competitive Analysis - Reminder</h2>
				<p>
					Strength: The reminder certainly has an aesthetic and minimalist design. All of the to-dos live inside cards. The card stack design also allows users to quickly find what they need. Flexibility and efficiency of use - for users who wish to quickly add a card or a reminder item, they can quickly do so by clicking on the shortcut button on the top right. The shortcut helps pro-users quickly achieve their goals.

					sWeaknesses Users would want to have a function to see all of their to-dos on the same page. Inside a card, adding-to-do button is at the bottom of the screen. Since human eyes’ movement moves naturally from top to bottom, it seems to be a poor design decision.

				<h2>Competitive Analysis - Asana</h2>
				<p>
					Strength:<br>
					Love that users can switch between work projects and personal projects. It allows users to both use it for work as well as for their personal needs. By doing so the, the app allows the users to not have to search for the exact ones in the project. 
				Different layout options help facilitate task management for different types of project. The list layout allows every task to be shown on a single screen. The board layout allows users to build different columns and add to-dos in them. The list caters to single goal tasks in which showing all tasks in one place is helpful. The board layout, on the other side, seems to be more helpful for projects with different deadlines and aspects to be done. 


				Weaknesses:<br>
				The visual designs are not consistent, and it feels like it borrowed a lot of elements from different public UI kits.
				As a project management platform, Asana doesn’t currently offer a variety of functions other than task management to allow it to excel in competitions against other platforms such as Basecamp or Yammer. The basecamp and Yammer provides chat rooms and allows for customized integrations with other applications such as Slack, JIRA that are popular among the offices.
