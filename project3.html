				<h2>Project Overview</h2>
				<p>
					Practice prototyping and basic web dev skills by prototyping an online store for a specialty boutique in HTML/CSS/Javascript.
					<br>
					<br>
					My client is Bun Bun Bake Shop: We are a small bakery that specializes in cinnamon rolls, from our famous classic cinnamon roll to a variety of artisan flavors. Our shop is located in Pittsburgh, PA, but we ship fresh rolls to anywhere in the USA. Visitors to our site should be able to buy cinnamon rolls by different flavors:

				<h2>Challenges in coding</h2>
				<p>
					My coding skill is in no match with my design skill, and that makes the coding part really overwhelming and daunting for me. Therefore, I decided to approach coding in a top-down workflow ease my anxiety. In this workflow, I first try to establish a visual structure through code, and fills the details in later. The visual structure is built by drawing gray blocks in code to emulate the approximate layout of my design. Later, the details are filled in much easier and quicker. This method not only ensure that my code can perfectly manifest my design but also code starts to become structured as well. In the process, I start to see the patterns in my code and try to reuse similar structure as much as possible.

				<h2>Design Decisions</h2>
				<p>
					Bun Bun Bake Shop has three words with B as their capital letter. The triple B and the three popping sound they produce instantly bring images to people’s minds of an experience that are light-hearted, joyful and full of fragrant buns in the shop. Therefore, when I was designing the experience and the branding for the shop, I try to manifest these adjectives and features of the shop through visuals. The website is designed to provide a very light-hearted and joyful experience. The color is most black and white to allow users to immerse themselves in browsing through the colorful and saliva-stimulating images of buns. Logo and button are the only two visual elements with cinnamon color. I chose to use cinnamon because it reminds people of the bun they covet.
